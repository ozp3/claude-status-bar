# Acknowledgements

Claude Status Bar's multi-session support grew out of several community contributions. Thank you to:

- **[@BrennenRocks](https://github.com/BrennenRocks)**, [PR #13](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/13): the per-session / multi-session implementation. Major contributions here.
- **[@marcosarzuza](https://github.com/marcosarzuza)**, [PR #11](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/11): the early multi-session precursor, plus multi-CLI testing and feedback.
- **[@angelo-swe](https://github.com/angelo-swe)**, [PR #17](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/17): another take at multi-session and the priority-sorting menu design.
- **[@CXRommel](https://github.com/CXRommel)**, [PR #14](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/14): multi-account support. More credit to come, this'll take things to the next level when we're ready for it.
- **[@nacalorea](https://github.com/nacalorea)**, [PR #18](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/18): for the reminder to ship an Intel universal binary, not just Apple Silicon.
- **[@florianheysen](https://github.com/florianheysen)**, [PR #15](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/15): suggested and provided the base for making Crab Walking follow the System color. Building on that, I tweaked it to add depth instead of the flat single-color approach. Thank you for this.
- **[@gingerbeardman](https://github.com/gingerbeardman)**, [issue #3](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/issues/3): an early supporter; an early bug report that pinned down the app quitting while Claude was still working.
- **[@ethan0905](https://github.com/ethan0905)**, [PR #37](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/37): git branch names in the session rows and the parent-folder disambiguation for same-named projects, with a nicely cheap no-git-spawn HEAD read. I patched two edge cases after merging (a folder that becomes a repo mid-session stayed branchless until restart, and location-unknown sessions forced a bogus qualifier). Thank you for contributing.
- **[@moritzwendt](https://github.com/moritzwendt)**, [PR #34](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar/pull/34): caught a build.sh bug where the signing-identity lookup aborted a from-source build under `set -eo pipefail` when no Developer ID cert is installed, instead of falling back to an ad-hoc build.

Thanks as well to everyone who opened issues and pull requests along the way.
